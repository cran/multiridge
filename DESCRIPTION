Description: Multi-penalty linear, logistic and cox ridge regression, including estimation of the penalty parameters by efficient (repeated) cross-validation and marginal likelihood maximization. Multiple high-dimensional data types that require penalization are allowed, as well as unpenalized variables. Paired and preferential data types can be specified. See Van de Wiel et al. (2021), <arXiv:2005.09301>.
